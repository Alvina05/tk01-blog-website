## Overview of Project

The objective of this project is to make you able to develop a website on your own. For this particular project you have to develop a blog website with HTML and CSS.

A blog is an online informational website displaying information about different topics in the reverse chronological order, which means that the latest posts appear first (we are not going to focus on the order right now). It is a platform where a writer or even a group of writers share their views on an individual subject.

Your blog website can be about fashion, cooking, tech news or anything that you like the most.

## Steps to be considered while developing your first website

You should never start your project without a clear vision. You can never solve a whole problem directly, it’s essential to break your overall problem into small pieces/steps to work on. There are certain steps that can help you achieve your goal systematically. We are guiding you to think about this website development project into smaller steps. For next projects, you will have to think about them yourself.

**Step 01:** <br>
> Choose a topic to make a blog for.

**Step 02:**  <br>
> Now the first thing you need to do is map down the layout of your website. Choose a good layout for your project. 
Layout is very crucial in any website. You can use any html layout to align content on your website. Following are some HTML layout examples, you can create your own too.

**Step 03:**  <br>
> Once you are sure of the layout, find out which semantic tags you will need to design the layout. These semantic tags would be the one having no visual effect work like a simple div but with a meaning in the context of layout.
Some examples are header, nav, main, article, section, footer, aside, figure etc

**Step 04:**  <br>
> A blog website usually has images and content along with it. Upon clicking on a blog, it’s details are shown to the user on another page. Find out where you will need to use hyperlinks in your project.

**Step 05:**  <br>
> Image pixel quality is very important in any website. Choose those pictures that do not lose their quality upon changing its height or width.
We must use copyright free images while development, some of the websites that provide copyright free high quality images are here: <br>

**Step 06:**  <br>
> You can also think of places where you want a list of elements to work with. This will help you manage your code and apply styles in an easier way.

**Step 07:**  <br>
> Start writing the html markup for your project. Always start in sequence for example if your layout has header first, work on the header section. 

**Step 08:**  <br>
> A good practice is to always enclose your related tags in a single div or semantic element if applicable, that helps us to style those tags.

**Step 09:**  <br>
> Give meaningful class names to your tags. This is very important because it later helps you manage the code easily. It will also allow other team members working on the project to easily understand your code.

**Step 10:**  <br>
> You can use comments to label your sections in both html and css files to easily comprehend the code later. 

**Step 11:**  <br>
> If you have used hyperlinks, provide proper relative paths to that file otherwise your code will not function as you would expect. 

**Step 12:**  <br>
> Test your website and see if the relative links you provided work. If not, see the three common errors taught to you in class that are usually made while writing relative paths.

**Step 13:**  <br>
> Once you complete writing html markup for your project, it’s time to add CSS. Use an external stylesheet to add styles to your project.

**Step 14:**  <br>
> A website should have a sync between all its elements. Choose a color that you want as the theme and color that you want your buttons or headings to be. 

**Step 15:**  <br>
> While writing CSS, start with declaring the wildcard first. This will let you give a  similar feel throughout your project. 

**Step 16:**
  <br>
> Add background colors to your elements along with other basic style properties.

**Step 17:**
  <br>
> Use devtools to see how an element would look on a particular style. It will help you to see the prompt result of the change in your browser without changing the code. Copy the style property then you feel best fits your html tag.

**Step 18:**
  <br>
> Determine which elements are supposed to use the entire width of the browser and which elements you want to place next to each other. Obtain this by impling correct display properties.

**Step 19:**
  <br>
> If you have used images in your code, define its properties. It’s always better to provide images as background-image through CSS if images are used for decoration. Only use the <img/> tag when it’s used as part of the content of a webpage.

**Step 20:**
  <br>
> After you are done writing basic CSS, work on positioning the elements properly on the browser screen. Use correct style properties to position elements.

**Step 21:**
  <br>
> Now comes the part where you need to work on alignments. Use the box model properties to adjust your content.

**Step 22:**
  <br>
> If you are unable to see a CSS property in the browser that you wrote in the code, see the manner how you have declared it. Priority based on declaration is essential when writing the same property for the same element.

**Step 23:**
  <br>
> Use devtools to debug your code if you have any problem in HTML and CSS not working as expected. 

### GOOD LUCK!
